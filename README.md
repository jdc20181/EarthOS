# EarthOS
A  Basic and modern Operating System (WIP)


A couple goals:

Be able to run .NET Framework based applications from a OS Shell that isn't Microsoft, well...Sortta. I am starting the project off of COSMOS, as this wil help develop my skills, to move toward a Linux Kernel Based OS (Coming in another project after this one hopefully)

Installtion, User Guides and releases are all WIP and coming soon!
